# Line Encoding and Decoding Techniques
Assignment Overview
This assignment explores various digital signal encoding techniques and involves the development of a Python function to detect the longest palindrome within a given binary message. The assignment aims to enhance your understanding of digital signal encoding methods and string manipulation in Python.

Assignment Objectives
Understand and implement different digital signal encoding techniques, including Unipolar NRZ, NRZ-L, NRZ-I, Manchester, Differential Manchester, AMI, Pseudoternary, Scrambling B8ZS, and HDB3.
Develop Python functions for each of the encoding methods.
Apply regular expressions in Python to identify patterns in a binary message and perform substitutions.
Create a Python function to detect and output the longest palindrome within a binary message.
Assignment Details
Assignment Type: Programming and Algorithm Implementation
Requirements: You are required to implement the specified digital signal encoding functions and a longest palindrome detection function using Python.
Input: The assignment takes a binary message as input, and you can select one of the encoding methods (1-9) to apply.
Output: The output will be the encoded signal based on the selected encoding method and the identification of the longest palindrome in the input message.
Resources: Python, matplotlib, and regular expressions are essential resources for this assignment.
